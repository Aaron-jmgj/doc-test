## 4.3 Farms (LP Staking)

The logic for staking, adding stake, extending lock-up period, renewing, unlocking, and claiming rewards is the same as for single-coin mining pools. For detailed instructions, please refer to the tutorial in the simple staking section.

### 4.3.1 **Adding Liquidity and Staking**

You can use SGR rewards earned on EcoEarn to add liquidity and stake them early in the Farm pool. The minimum amount for adding liquidity is 10 rewards. If it’s your first time staking, you need to input a lock-up period of at least 7 days. For additional stakes, you must extend the lock-up period accordingly, ensuring it doesn’t fall below the longest release time node of the reward.

-   Go to the Farms page and click on “My Liquidity”.

# 5. **FAQ**

**5.1 Lock-up Period**

The lock-up period ranges from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 360 days. Longer lock-up periods yield higher Annual Percentage Rates (APR). You can enter any lock-up period in the input field or choose from platform-provided options: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 360 days.

**5.2 Unlocking Period (Grace Period)**

After the staking period ends, there is a 7-day grace period. During this time, you can unlock your position, claim rewards, and end the staking. If more than 7 days pass without action, the platform will re-stake all assets based on the remaining lock-up time from the most recent staking or additional deposit.

**5.3 Renewal**

During the grace period, you can renew your staked assets. The minimum lock-up period for renewal is 7 days.

**5.4 Reward Release Period**

After claiming rewards, there is a 90-day release period. Rewards are released gradually on days 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90. Detailed reward release information can be viewed on the “Rewards” page.

**5.5 Early Reward Staking**

You can stake received rewards early, including those already released and frozen. For single-coin pools, you can perform this action by clicking “Stake early” on the “Rewards” page. For dual-coin pools, visit the “Farms-My Liquidity” page and click “Add & Stake” or “Add Liquidity & Stake”.
